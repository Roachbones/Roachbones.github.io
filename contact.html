	<h1>contact me</h1>
</header>

<main>

<p>I'm pretty friendly. Feel free to reach out :3</p>
<p>Most people contact me with TV head questions, but you can talk to me about other stuff too.</p>

<h2>email</h2>
<p>You can email me at <em title="It's Vivian, by the way.">[my first name]</em>@<em title="by which I mean rose.systems">[this domain]</em>.</p>

<h2>Discord</h2>
<p>My Discord username is <strong>9409</strong>. Yes, literally just 9409. I wanted to keep my discriminator, so I kept <em>only</em> my discriminator.</p>
<p><strong>If you send me a friend request <em>without messaging me</em>, I will likely not accept it.</strong> I get way too many spam friend requests to accept them all. I might accept it if I happen to notice you have a TV head profile picture, but besides that, you're better off either sending me a message (though I know Discord makes it hard to message people without sending them a friend request first) or emailing me.</p>

<h2>social media</h2>
<p>I'm sometimes on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@vivianrose">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/m_u_s_h_r_o_o_m">Twitter</a>.</p>

<h2>Element</h2>
I'm @vivian:cybre.space on Element.
